🔗 Hello 
My Algo Bank – Algorand Smart Contract (Workshop 3.0 Python) Practice
This project demonstrates a Python smart contract deployed on the Algorand LocalNet using AlgoKit. The contract provides a simple App Call method and supports ALGO transactions within a simulation environment.

✅ Key Features:
📜 App Call Method:

Method: hello

Returns a custom greeting using the user’s name.

Example Output: "Hello, Adeel Arif Dev"

💸 Simulated Payment:

A transaction group simulates a 10 ALGO payment alongside the App Call.

Clear visual flow of the App Call and Payment is shown under Transaction Visual.

🔄 Transaction Summary:

App Call to method hello

Payment transaction of 10 ALGO (from caller to smart contract address)

Combined call & payment simulation successful on LocalNet

📍Current Deployment:
📡 LocalNet using AlgoKit UI

🧪 Features tested through simulation interface (Call + Add Transaction)
